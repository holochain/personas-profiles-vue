# Persona Field - New

The Personas hApp makes it easy for people to add new fields to any Persona. Each field has a **Field Name** and a **Field Value** and the auto-complete list of possible field names also contains what type of information it is. For example the **Full Name** field is single line text and the **Avatar** field is an image.
